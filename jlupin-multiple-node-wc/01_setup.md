# JLupin setup

Before proceeding to the next step, please wait until the setup scripts finish running.

Check if all microservices for both jlupin installations started completely:

NODE_1:
`/opt/jlupin/platform/start/control.sh microservice list`{{execute}}

NODE_2:
`/opt/jlupin/platform2/start/control.sh microservice list`{{execute}}
